# tuhc-doom
 Play DOOM, Heretic and Hexen in the [Unofficial Homestuck Collection](https://github.com/Bambosh/unofficial-homestuck-collection).
 
 Make sure to install it by grabbing a copy from the Releases on this repo. If you wish to clone the repo instead, make sure the mod files are in a folder titled 'tuhc-doom' in the mods folder, as having the name be anything else will break it.
